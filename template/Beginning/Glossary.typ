/*
Add your glossary terms below!

  - They will always be shown alphabetically;

  - If you don't specify a plural/longplural form, #gspl() will just add an s in case you call it;

  - You can create more than one glossary of this type if you want! Just make a new array, and then register and print it as well. Remember to add a title before it.

For any doubts, check the page of the imported package:
https://github.com/typst-community/glossarium
